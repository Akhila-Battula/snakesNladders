# Snakes and Ladders Game
Snakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game regarded today as a worldwide classic.
This project is all about developing this Snakes and Ladders game on a Computer. Python is used as the programming language, PyGame to include graphics. The game has two players, who get to roll the dice alternatively and reach the final square either helped by ladders or hindered by snakes.

Please note that there are two files:
- classic_game_python is a python program without use of any additional libraries.
- snakesNladders_pygame is developed using PyGame library.

Well honestly, this was my first python application that I had worked on during my undergraduation. There are missing parts in here but as far as I remember it was working upto a certain extent and felt it is worth having it here.
Hope it is helpful for you.
